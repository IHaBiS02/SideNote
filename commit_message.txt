refactor: Unify title styling and enhance dark mode

This commit refactors the CSS for view titles to use specific IDs instead of a generic h1 selector, improving style encapsulation and preventing conflicts.

- Replaced the h1 selector with IDs (#notes-list-title, #editor-title, etc.) for precise styling.
- Added a dark mode style for checkboxes to ensure they match the theme's aesthetic.
