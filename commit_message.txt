fix: Prevent auto space insertion when modifier keys are pressed with Enter

Adjusts the `keydown` event listener to ensure the "Auto Add Two Spaces on Enter" feature only triggers when the Enter key is pressed alone.

The check now ignores key presses when modifier keys (Shift, Ctrl, Alt, Meta) are active, preventing unexpected behavior with shortcuts like Shift+Enter.
