feat: Implement image pasting from clipboard

Enhances the paste event listener to support pasting images directly into the editor.

- When an image is pasted from the clipboard, it is saved to IndexedDB with a unique ID.
- A markdown image reference (`![Image](images/UNIQUE_ID.png)`) is inserted into the editor at the cursor's position.
- If no image is present, the existing text pasting functionality is used.
- Updates the note content and metadata after the paste operation.
