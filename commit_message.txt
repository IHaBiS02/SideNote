feat: Differentiate styling for single and multi-line code blocks

This commit introduces separate styling for single-line and multi-line code blocks to improve readability.

- Adds logic to `sidepanel.js` to detect single-line and multi-line code blocks and apply corresponding classes.
- Adjusts padding in `sidepanel.css` for `.single-line-code` and `.multi-line-code`.
- Refactors blockquote and list styling for better consistency.
