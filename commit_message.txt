fix: Adjust auto line break for multi-line pastes

Modifies the paste handling logic to prevent unwanted spaces when pasting text.

The auto line break feature now only adds two spaces to non-empty lines when pasting multi-line text, and it skips the last line. This ensures that pasting content mid-sentence or pasting single lines does not introduce extra spaces.
