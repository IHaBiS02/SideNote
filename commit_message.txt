feat: unify browser styles with normalize.css

This commit introduces normalize.css to create a consistent visual baseline across different browsers, specifically addressing rendering differences between Chrome and Firefox.

- Added `normalize.css` as a project dependency.
- Included `normalize.css` in `sidepanel.html` before other stylesheets to ensure proper style overriding.
- Bumped the version to 3.0.2 in `manifest.json` and `package.json`.
