feat: Implement Image Management UI

Adds a new UI for managing all images stored in the application.

- **New View:** Introduces an "Image Management" view accessible from the settings screen.
- **Image List:** Displays a list of all images from IndexedDB, showing a thumbnail, a partial ID, and a usage status icon.
- **Image Actions:**
  - Clicking a thumbnail opens a larger preview.
  - The usage icon indicates if an image is used in any note and can show which notes use it.
  - A delete button allows for permanent deletion of images from IndexedDB.
- **UI Integration:** The new view is integrated into the existing navigation and styling.
