feat: Implement new export logic for notes with images

Replaces the existing export functionality with a new system that packages notes and their images into zip archives.

- **Single Note Export (.snote):** Creates a zip file containing `note.md` (content), `metadata.json` (title, settings, etc.), and an `images/` folder with all images used in that specific note.
- **Multiple Notes Export (.snotes):** Creates a single zip file where each note is a folder named after its ID, and each folder has the same structure as a `.snote` file.
- Images are retrieved from IndexedDB and included in the archives.
