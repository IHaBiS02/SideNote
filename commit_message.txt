feat: Render images from IndexedDB in markdown preview

Updates the `renderMarkdown` function to display images stored in IndexedDB.

- After rendering the markdown to HTML, the function now scans for `<img>` tags with a local `images/` source.
- For each found image, it retrieves the image blob from IndexedDB using the `getImage()` function.
- A temporary Blob URL is created and set as the `src` for the `<img>` tag, making the image visible in the preview.
