MODEL: Got it. Thanks for the context!

USER: Like the images in @notes_edit_preview.png and @notes_edit_edit.png there are differences on the font when showing preview and edit. Can you change font on edit part so its text looks like the one in preview one?

MODEL: Okay, I see the font difference. I will find the responsible CSS rule and change the font in the edit view to match the preview. I'll start by examining `sidepanel.html` and `sidepanel.css`.

USER: Can you make title edit box is also center-aligned?

MODEL: Of course. I'll find the CSS rule for the title edit box and center-align it. I'll start by looking for the relevant code in `sidepanel.js`.

USER: As you can see in @title_not_center_aligned.png the title edit box is still not center-aligned.

MODEL: You are right. My apologies. The previous change only centered the text within the input box, not the box itself. I need to apply the same positioning to the `.title-input` as is on the `#editor-title`.

I will now correct the CSS in `sidepanel.css`.

USER: Can you add options for changing word size? Also, you should remember that the setting on the notes list effects to newly generated notes, while the settings on each note only affect to each notes and not affected by global settings.

MODEL: Okay, I'll add a font size option.

First, I'll add the font size setting to `sidepanel.html`. Then, I'll add the necessary CSS in `sidepanel.css`. Finally, I'll implement the logic in `sidepanel.js` to manage and apply the font size setting for both global and note-specific contexts, ensuring it's handled correctly when creating, opening, and configuring notes.

I'll start with `sidepanel.html`.

USER: Even I change font size to large, the size of text is not changed. Can you find the reason? Also, what is the exact size of small, medium, and large texts?

MODEL: Of course. I'll investigate why the font size isn't changing and provide the exact pixel values.

First, I'll check `sidepanel.css` to find the defined sizes for small, medium, and large fonts. Then, I'll review the JavaScript and HTML to understand why the style isn't being applied correctly.

I'll start by reading `sidepanel.css`.

USER: On the previous code which doesn't have settings for text, what's the default size of it?

MODEL: To determine that, I'll check the previous version of the `sidepanel.css` file before the font size settings were added.

USER: Can you change settings of font size from dropbox of small, medium, and large to font size as a number?

MODEL: Of course. I'll replace the font size dropdown with a number input.

First, I'll modify `sidepanel.html` to change the `<select>` element to an `<input type="number">`. Then, I'll update `sidepanel.js` to handle the numeric font size, and finally, I'll remove the unnecessary classes from `sidepanel.css`.

I'll start with `sidepanel.html`.

USER: Can you set the default value of font size as 12?

MODEL: Of course. I'll change the default font size to 12 in `sidepanel.js`.

USER: I also want you to write value 12 on the settings.

MODEL: Of course. I'll set the default value of the font size input to 12 in `sidepanel.html`.

USER: Can you add some spaces between each settings in settings page?

MODEL: Of course. I'll add some space between the settings on the settings page by modifying `sidepanel.css`.

USER: Can you also add margin between header and settings in settings page?

MODEL: Of course. I'll add a margin between the header and the settings container in `sidepanel.css`.

USER: Is there any way to add highlights on code area in markdown? Don't write the code, just say some ways to do it.

MODEL: Yes, there are several ways to add syntax highlighting to the Markdown preview.

The most common approach is to use a dedicated JavaScript library for syntax highlighting. You would integrate this library with the existing `marked.js` parser.

Here are a few popular options:

1.  **highlight.js:** A widely-used and powerful library that can automatically detect and highlight code in many different languages. You would configure `marked.js` to use `highlight.js` for processing code blocks.

2.  **Prism.js:** A lightweight and extensible syntax highlighter. It's known for its modularity, allowing you to include support only for the languages you need. Similar to `highlight.js`, you would hook it into the `marked.js` rendering process.

The general process for either library involves:
*   Including the library's JavaScript and a CSS theme file in your project.
*   Updating the `marked.js` configuration to call the highlighting library whenever it encounters a code block during parsing.

USER: Then, can you use highlight.js on the code block of markdown on preview of notes? You can use curl for download highlight.js file.

MODEL: Okay, I'll add `highlight.js` for syntax highlighting.

First, I'll download the `highlight.js` library and a default CSS theme into the `vendor` directory using `curl`. Then, I'll update `sidepanel.html` to include these new files and modify `sidepanel.js` to configure `marked.js` to use `highlight.js` for highlighting code blocks.

I'll start by listing the contents of the `vendor` directory.

USER: I don't think code highlight doesn't work for markdown. I want to implement the features that using '```' as code highlighting, and write the programming language written next to the '```' which opens the code block define the language highlight syntax.

MODEL: You are right. The current implementation should handle fenced code blocks with language specifiers, but it seems there's an issue. I'll investigate and fix it.

It's likely that `marked.js` is not configured to properly pass the language to `highlight.js`. I will correct the configuration.

First, I'll re-examine `sidepanel.js` to correct the `marked.js` setup.

USER: As you can see in the image @code_highlight_edit.png and @code_highlight_preview.png code highlighting is not working in this code. I want it works like the image in @code_highlight_example.png Can you edit code and fix this problem?

MODEL: Of course. It seems like the Markdown parser isn't correctly identifying the fenced code blocks, and the theme doesn't match your example. I'll fix this by taking the following steps:

1.  **Update Markdown Parser:** I'll upgrade the `marked.js` library to the latest version to ensure it properly handles GitHub-flavored Markdown, including fenced code blocks.
2.  **Switch to a Dark Theme:** I'll download the "Atom One Dark" theme for `highlight.js` to match the style in your example image and replace the current light theme.
3.  **Configure Sanitizer:** I'll adjust the `DOMPurify` sanitizer to ensure it doesn't remove the CSS classes that `highlight.js` uses for styling.

I'll start by updating the `marked.js` library.

USER: It still looks same! Can you check how it gather code block from the markdown text?

MODEL: You're right to be persistent. The problem lies in how the newer version of the `marked.js` library processes the Markdown. Starting from version 5, the `marked.parse()` function is asynchronous, meaning it returns a Promise that resolves with the HTML. My previous code was not waiting for this process to complete.

Additionally, the `highlight.js` classes were being stripped by the sanitizer.

I will fix this by making the following changes:

1.  **Make `renderMarkdown` Asynchronous:** I'll update the `renderMarkdown` function to be `async` and properly `await` the result from `marked.parse()`.
2.  **Update Callers:** I'll update the functions that call `renderMarkdown` to be `async` as well.
3.  **Fix Sanitizer Configuration:** I'll adjust the `DOMPurify` configuration to explicitly allow the `span` tag, which `highlight.js` uses extensively for styling individual tokens in the code.

I will start by modifying `sidepanel.js`.

USER: It still looks same! Can you check how it gather code block from the markdown text?

MODEL: You are right to be skeptical. It seems my previous attempts have not resolved the issue. The problem is almost certainly in how the markdown is being parsed and sanitized.

I will take a more direct approach to fix this. I will make the following changes:

1.  **Enable GFM:** I'll explicitly enable GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) in the `marked.js` configuration. This will ensure that fenced code blocks are correctly parsed.
2.  **Fix Sanitizer:** I'll update the `DOMPurify` configuration to allow the `span` tag, which `highlight.js` uses to apply styles to the code.

I will now modify `sidepanel.js` to implement these changes.

USER: Well, it still doesn't work... Just revert all changes about code highlighting and start from zero.

MODEL: You are right to be frustrated. My apologies for the repeated failures. I will revert all the changes we've made regarding code highlighting and start fresh.

First, I will identify and revert the commits related to syntax highlighting. I'll start by looking at the git log.

USER: Now, I want you to check all libraries we use in this project and find if it is fine to use those libraries when I use them in my project, which I plan to release as chrome extension. Also, if there are some conditions I should follow when I use those libraries, please also say it too.

MODEL: Of course. I will check the licenses for all the libraries used in this project and outline the conditions you need to follow.

First, I'll identify the libraries we're using by checking the `vendor` directory. Then, for each library, I'll find its license and summarize the requirements.

USER: Can you add licenses section on the settings folder, as a button, and if the user press it then show it to the user? Maybe showing them in markdown notes-like view while not allowing user to edit it would be enough.

MODEL: Of course. I'll add a "Licenses" section to the settings page. When a user clicks the "Licenses" button, it will open a new, non-editable note-like view displaying the license information for all the open-source libraries used in the project.

Here's how I'll implement this:

1.  **Create a `LICENSES.md` File:** I'll create a new Markdown file named `LICENSES.md` and populate it with the license text for each library.
2.  **Add a "Licenses" Button:** I'll add a "Licenses" button to the settings page in `sidepanel.html`.
3.  **Create a License View:** I'll create a new view in `sidepanel.html` to display the license information.
4.  **Implement the Logic:** In `sidepanel.js`, I'll add the necessary logic to read the `LICENSES.md` file, render it as HTML, and display it in the new view when the "Licenses" button is clicked.

I'll start by creating the `LICENSES.md` file.

USER: Like the @Licenses.png showing, license page doesn't automatically doing line changes when the width is small. Can you fix this feature?

MODEL: Of course. The issue is that the `<pre>` tags used for the license text are not set to wrap their content, which causes the text to overflow horizontally.

I will fix this by adding a CSS rule to `sidepanel.css` that forces the text inside the license view to wrap.

USER: Even after fixing, as you can see in @license_wide_width.png and @license_narrow_width.png images, the license is still not line-breaking which is encased in '```' block.

MODEL: You are absolutely right. My apologies. The previous CSS rule was too general and didn't specifically target the `pre` elements inside the license view, which are the ones causing the overflow.

I will now add a more specific CSS rule to `sidepanel.css` to fix this.

USER: Now, can you add line number in code block? And also, I want you to add features that auto line-breaking when showing long codes.

MODEL: Of course. I can add line numbers and automatic line-breaking to the code blocks.

Here's how I'll do it:

1.  **Download Line Numbering Plugin:** I'll download the `highlightjs-line-numbers.js` plugin, which is a popular add-on for `highlight.js` that provides line numbering.
2.  **Update HTML:** I'll include the new plugin in `sidepanel.html`.
3.  **Implement Line Numbering:** In `sidepanel.js`, I'll modify the `renderMarkdown` function to apply line numbers to the code blocks after they have been highlighted.
4.  **Add CSS for Styling:** I'll add CSS to `sidepanel.css` to style the line numbers and to handle the automatic line-breaking for long lines of code.

I'll start by downloading the `highlightjs-line-numbers.js` plugin.

USER: can you add box around code block and fill inside with light grey color for better vision?

MODEL: Of course. I'll add a light grey background and a border to the code blocks to make them more visible. I'll do this by adding a new CSS rule to `sidepanel.css`.

USER: can you add little spaces between lines and code/index number in code block? And also I want the index number has more visible color like black.

MODEL: Of course. I'll adjust the spacing and color of the line numbers in the code blocks. I'll do this by modifying the CSS rules in `sidepanel.css`.

USER: can you write all conversations in this session in single .txt file?

MODEL: Of course. I will save our entire conversation from this session into a file named `conversation_history.txt`.
